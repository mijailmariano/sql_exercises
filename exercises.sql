-- Query_001: the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. 
-- Your result cannot contain duplicates.

-- NOTES:
-- 'UNIQUE' METHOD - ensures there are no duplicate values stored in a particular column or a set of columns
-- 'DISTICT' KEYWORD - is used in the SELECT statement to fetch distinct rows from a table
-- 'LEFT' FUNCTION - extracts a number of characters from a string (starting from left): LEFT(string, number_of_chars)

-- SOLUTION
SELECT UNIQUE(CITY)
    FROM STATION
        WHERE LEFT(CITY, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');


-- Query_002 the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. 
-- Your result cannot contain duplicates.

-- NOTES:
-- I CAN TRY A 'RIGHT' FUNCTION TO CHECK THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS OF A STRING STARTING FROM THE RIGHT
-- ALSO KEEPING IN MIND THAT THE QUERY SEARCH IS CASE SENSITIVE, SO VOWELS SHOULD ALL BE LOWER CASE
-- WILL ALSO USE A 'DISTINCT' KEYWORD IN THE SELECT STATEMENT
-- "RIGHT" FUNCTION: extracts a number of characters from a string (starting from right): RIGHT(string, number_of_chars)

-- SOLUTION
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
    FROM STATION
        WHERE RIGHT(CITY, 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');


-- Query_003 the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. 
-- Your result cannot contain duplicates.

-- NOTES:
-- COULD PROBABLY ALSO SOLVE THIS USING REGULAR EXPRESSION 'REGEXP' example: '^[AEIOU].*[aeiou]$'

-- SOLUTION
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
    FROM STATION 
        WHERE LEFT(CITY, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')
            AND
                RIGHT(CITY, 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'); 


-- Query_004 the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. 
-- Your result cannot contain duplicates.

-- NOTES:
-- USING THE 'NOT IN' CLAUSE TO CHECK AND ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK
-- WHERE 'NOT IN' IS EXPRESSION - 'DOES NOT EQUAL TO' OR 'IS NOT LIKE'

-- SOLUTION
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
    FROM STATION
        WHERE LEFT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');


-- Query_005 the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. 
-- Your result cannot contain duplicates.

-- SOLUTION
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
    FROM STATION
        WHERE RIGHT(CITY, 1) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');


-- Query_006 the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. 
-- Your result cannot contain duplicates.

-- SOLUTION
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
    FROM STATION
        WHERE CITY NOT RLIKE '^[aeiou]'
            OR CITY NOT REGEXP '[aeiou]$'

-- Query_007 the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. 
-- Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY

            AND CITY NOT RLIKE '^[aeiou]';

-- Query_008 the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks. 
-- Order your output by the last three characters of each name. 
-- If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), 
-- secondary sort them by ascending ID.

SELECT Name
    FROM STUDENTS
        WHERE Marks > 75
            ORDER BY RIGHT(Name, 3), ID;


-- Query_009 Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.

-- Query_010 Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. 
-- Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

-- Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
-- Isosceles: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
-- Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
-- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

-- We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly (salary x months) worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
-- Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as space-separated integers.

-- today earnings == salary x number of tenured moths at company
-- query 1: max today earnings for all employees
-- query 2: total number of employees who have the max total earnings
-- return max total earnins and total number of employees with this earnings

-- similar to a python/pandas 'value_counts()' function
-- 1. create a new column (salary*months) aliased as 'total_earnings'
-- 2. create a second column which is the count of all records/employees
-- 3. group by total_earnings which is the earnings and number of employee that have earned this amount
-- 4. order by the total_earnings amount in descending order (from highest-lowest)
-- 5. limit the query to only return the highest total-earnings value

SELECT (salary*months) AS total_earnings, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
    GROUP BY total_earnings
        ORDER BY total_earnings DESC
